Website for a fake car dealership that allows user registration and login.  Login can tell whether or not a user is a staff member, and if user is a staff member,
they will be allowed to use the Edit Cars tab.  The Edit Cars tab allows a Staff member to add a car to the DataBase.  To add a car to the database, the staff member
will need to input the cars brand, type, price, package, interior color, exterior color, and vin number.  All users (whether they are a staff member or a regular user, 
or don't have an account at all) are able to use the Search tab.  The Search tab allows a user to sort the dealerships collcetion of cars based on brand, package, or price
in either ascending or descending order.  After sorting the collection of cars, the user is able to click on the car they are interested in and read about the detains of that
car.  Throughout the website, there are alert buttons that will pop up if the user does something that they aren't supposed to do (Ex. try to add their own car to the collection
without being a staff member).

Koray Akcabal, Richard Shinnick, and Wesley Erd have equally worked on every major file in this project so it was very difficult to give credit 
to each individual file because each person mentioned has put in an equal amount of work.
